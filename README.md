# üîê Crypto Ciphers ‚Äî Caesar & Vigen√®re (C Project)

This project implements two classic substitution ciphers ‚Äî **Caesar** and **Vigen√®re** ‚Äî as a modular C program that can **encrypt** and **decrypt** uppercase text from the command line.

It was developed as part of a programming assignment focusing on **modular design**, **header files**, and **command-line interfaces** in C.

## üß© Overview

The program supports the following command-line format:

```bash
./crypto MODE ALGORITHM TEXT [KEY]

### parameter
| Argument    | Description                                                              |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `MODE`      | `e` or `encrypt` for encryption, `d` or `decrypt` for decryption         |
| `ALGORITHM` | `c` or `caesar` for Caesar cipher, `v` or `vigenere` for Vigen√®re cipher |
| `TEXT`      | Uppercase message to encrypt/decrypt (A‚ÄìZ only, no spaces)               |
| `[KEY]`     | Only required for Vigen√®re cipher (e.g. `LEMON`)                         |
